# My Hero

## Verse 1
When I was young, my hero seemed to know everything
An omniscient being with answers to all my questions
When I was young, my father was stronger than anyone
A superhero who could lift any heavy burden

Nothing in the world scared me
As long as my guardian was by my side
As long as his big hand held my small one
Nothing could hurt me

## Verse 2
To my newly adult self, my hero appeared more frail and aged
He seemed like an ordinary person who no longer knew everything
Foolishly, I was arrogant about my time having come
I mistakenly thought I knew the world better now

As I grew a little older, I realized how much this champion sacrificed for family
The silent endurance of pain, abandoned dreams, drops of sweat
He still loves me, more sincerely than anyone, so quietly
I'm finally beginning to understand the weight of it all

## Chorus
Please don't fade away
Stay in my life forever
Your wisdom, your love, your sacrifice
I love you my hero, my father
