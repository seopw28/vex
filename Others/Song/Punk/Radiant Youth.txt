## title: Radiant Youth

## Verse 1
Our youth raced through the dawn
Passion burst with no bounds
I miss who we were back then
When we thought all dreams could come true

## Chorus
Radiant youth, shining bright
Those times light up the night
Golden days, cherished years
Forever in our hearts
Those bright days, those dear times
They're who we are today

## Verse 2
Sometimes we felt hearts torn by farewells
But even those times were dear
The most radiant time of life
I became who I am today

## Bridge
Hold on to the feeling
Our bright youth
Our golden days

## Chorus
Radiant youth, shining bright
Those times light up the night
Golden days, cherished years
Forever in our hearts
Those bright days, those dear times
They're who we are today
