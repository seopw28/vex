# Best Crew

## Verse 1
We met by chance
Unique in our own ways
Looking at the same things
With diverse eyes, varied thoughts

## Pre-Chorus
But these contrasts
Made us even stronger
Learning from each other
Growing side by side

## Chorus
Creating synergy on the front line
My precious teammates
Smiling through the hard times
Together we made it happen

## Verse 2
Each one shining with their own color
Our one-of-a-kind team
With a rhythm and energy
No one else could match

## Pre-Chorus
Like puzzle pieces distinct
Fitting perfectly together
The joy of success we shared
Every moment glowing bright

## Chorus
Creating synergy on the front line
My precious teammates
Smiling through the hard times
Together we made it happen

## Bridge
Though we're apart now
The time we spent as one
I'll never forget
As we walk separate paths

## Final Chorus
Today and tomorrow
May good luck be with you
I pray from my heart
For my best crew ever

Our shared moments
Will shine on forever
Best Crew, I'm cheering for you
