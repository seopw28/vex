# Stand Alone

## Verse 1
I know in the end we all go to our graves alone
Yet I'm still afraid of loneliness
I know that love isn't meant to last forever
Yet I still desperately crave it

While I'm still breathing, completely on my own
When loneliness tightens around my throat
I gasp for air and cry out
To anyone who'll listen, just for a moment, just a brief moment
Please hold me close and comfort me

## Verse 2
I'm not innocent enough to believe in eternal love
That's why goodbyes hurt even more
Afraid of being alone, I search for someone
But in the end, all that returns is emptiness

While I'm still breathing, completely on my own
When loneliness tightens around my throat
I gasp for air and cry out
To anyone who'll listen, just for a moment, just a brief moment
Please hold me close and comfort me

## Chorus
Stand alone, stand alone
In the end, I'm on my own
Stand alone, stand alone
But I still have to carry on
