# Salvation

## Verse 1
When the harsh coldness of society becomes hard to breathe
When no one acknowledges who I am
Like the spring sunshine melting the cold snow
You shone your light on me
The small hand you reached out
Shined brighter than any hope
And I was able to stand again

## Chorus
Thank you for appearing in my life like fate
Thank you for becoming the meaning of my life
To me, who was lost in the darkness
You became the light
You, who became my salvation

## Verse 2
Though we may not spark like fireworks every moment
I'll now stand silently before you and protect you
Even in this shaking world
