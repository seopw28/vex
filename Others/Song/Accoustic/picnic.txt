# Picnic Day

## Verse 1
We got along so well
On a day with bright sun and cool breeze
We fled from our work
Throwing off the weight of our days

## Verse 2
A cold beer quenched our thirst
By the river we spread our mat with songs
Those times filled with laughter
As time passed by so slow

## Chorus
City lights that shone so bright
Water drops from the fountain gleamed
I still recall so clear
The true smiles we shared that day

## Bridge
What won't change with time
Are the mem'ries we made back then
Today the sky is clear
And the breeze feels so fresh and nice

## Final Chorus
No matter where you are
I hope you're having a good day too
I wait for when we'll meet
With a smile on my face today
