# Jet Mode

## Verse 1
Spreading the wings of our warm youth
We've grown together all this time
Now it's the moment to take our first step
Into the cold, harsh reality
Though it's a bit scary and unfamiliar
Believe in the courage within you
We can make it, without a doubt

## Chorus
Let's go into Jet Mode
Turn the power up to maximum
Soaring through the open sky
Leaving all fears behind
With our deadly Jet Mode
Overclocking our passion
Toward our dreams

## Verse 2
Even when setbacks come our way
We'll never break down, never surrender
Failure is just the foundation for success
Prepare to fly even higher
When moments of doubt arrive
Hold my hand tight
Together, we have nothing to fear

## Chorus
Let's go into Jet Mode
Turn the power up to maximum
Soaring through the open sky
Leaving all fears behind
With our deadly Jet Mode
Overclocking our passion
Toward our dreams

## Bridge
Sometimes fierce winds may blow
But our flight will never stop
As long as we trust each other and hold hands
We can overcome any storm

## Final Chorus
Let's go into Jet Mode
Turn the power up to maximum
Soaring through the open sky
Leaving all fears behind
With our deadly Jet Mode
Overclocking our passion
Toward our dreams
In Jet Mode!
