# Simulation

### Verse A
In truth, we live in a simulation
In this world made of code and math
Bits of light seen when I shut my eyes
We're just pawns in some code plan

### Pre-Chorus
Don't things feel odd?
This fake world we deem real

### Chorus
At light speed, too much data's needed to show
That's why time slows down
Laws of physics are just code limits
The world we live in is a simulation!

### Verse B
Babes and old folks get less space in RAM
That's why they can't recall well
No thoughts of birth
And facts fade as we age

### Pre-Chorus
Don't things feel odd?
This fake world we deem real

### Chorus
At light speed, too much data's needed to show
That's why time slows down
Laws of physics are just code limits
The world we live in is a simulation!

### Bridge
Black holes turn mass to data
Bits that form things jump in steps
If they flowed smooth, the host would fail
All of this is proof!

### Final Chorus
At light speed, too much data's needed to show
That's why time slows down
Laws of physics are just code limits
The world we live in is a simulation!

Simulation!
