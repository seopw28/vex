# Song of the Slave

## Verse 1
Here comes Monday once again
Not yet at work but I want to leave
In these tall, cold walls of glass
I work to make someone else's dreams come true

## Chorus
The name of the firm means nothing to me
It's just a badge that marks me as a slave
Each dawn, the same old rite goes on
With chains around my neck, I go to work

## Verse 2
I tell the young ones, "Chase your dreams"
But truth be told, I've got mouths to feed
I see my small one's smile so bright
I clutch my breaking heart so tight
And one more day, I work for someone else

## Chorus
The name of the firm means nothing to me
It's just a badge that marks me as a slave
Each dawn, the same old rite goes on
With chains around my neck, I go to work
